# Sunshines Walkies

This project is an application allowing users to search on a specific day and location when the best conditions for a dog walk are depending on choosable criteria.

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project was to practice and solidify my knowledge of React and API calls among other technologies.

## Technologies used
- **React**: building a multi-component web app using pros and hooks

- **CSS modules**: modular approach for component-specific design. Responsive design. Design the best user experience
- **Bootstrap** : design functional, clean and easy components for the best user experience

## Features
Search for weather details on a given location and date:
- the user can enter a location by the name of a city anywhere in the world or by GPS coordinates
- the date of the search can be any date within the next 14 days on the day of the search

- the main criteria for the search are daylight hours. This cannot be changed by the user
- 3 criteria are implemented and can be selected, or not, by the user: 
..- chance of rain <20%
..- temperature > 0°c
..- temperature < 25°c
    
- the search results display time slots within daylight hours for the given day and location during which they can take the best dog walks according to their criteria.
